# Project-Data-Driven-Product-Management-Conducting-a-Market-Analysis
This project helps the fitness studio explore interest in workouts at a global and national level.
I explore local and international markets to find opportunities for the fitness products. I used data manipulation skills to examine data about online interest in home gyms, gym workouts, home workouts, and fitness products, and create visualizations to help guide the product decisions.

Instructions:

-When was the global search for 'workout' at its peak? 

-Of the keywords available, what was the most popular during the covid pandemic, and what is the most popular now?

-What country has the highest interest for workouts among the following: United States, Australia, or Japan? 

-You'd be interested in expanding your virtual home workouts offering to either the Philippines or Malaysia. Which of the two countries has the highest interest in home workouts?
