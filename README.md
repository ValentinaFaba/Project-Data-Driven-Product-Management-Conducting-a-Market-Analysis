# Project-Data-Driven-Product-Management-Conducting-a-Market-Analysis
This project helps the fitness studio explore interest in workouts at a global and national level.
I explore local and international markets to find opportunities for the fitness products. I used data manipulation skills to examine data about online interest in home gyms, gym workouts, home workouts, and fitness products, and create visualizations to help guide the product decisions.

Instructions:

-When was the global search for 'workout' at its peak? Save the year of peak interest as a string named year_str in the format "yyyy".

-Of the keywords available, what was the most popular during the covid pandemic, and what is the most popular now? Save your answers as variables called peak_covid and current respectively.

-What country has the highest interest for workouts among the following: United States, Australia, or Japan? Save your answer as top_country.

-You'd be interested in expanding your virtual home workouts offering to either the Philippines or Malaysia. Which of the two countries has the highest interest in home workouts? Identify the country and save it as home_workout_geo.
